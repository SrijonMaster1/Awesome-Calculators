# Awesome-Calculators
This repository is for all sorts of calculators built using various languages. Try running the Insane_Calculator.py using `python Insane_Calculator.py` or `python3 Insane_Calculator.py` as it is pretty insane! Have fun coming up with new ideas and implementing them. I am open to any suggestions. ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ
### **Also feel free to file issues for new creative ideas for calculators. Also don't hesitate to create pull requests in order to add new calculators in different languages.**
